abstract = {{Drugs of abuse can persistently change the reward circuit in ways that contribute to relapse behavior, partly via mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure and function. Nuclear orphan receptor subfamily4 groupA member2 (NR4A2, also known as NURR1) is an important effector of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent mechanisms in persistent memory processes and is highly expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), a region that regulates nicotine-associated behaviors. Here, expressing the Nr4a2 dominant negative (Nurr2c) in the MHb blocks reinstatement of cocaine seeking in mice. We use single-nucleus transcriptomics to characterize the molecular cascade following Nr4a2 manipulation, revealing changes in transcriptional networks related to addiction, neuroplasticity, and GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling. The network controlled by NR4A2 is characterized using a transcription factor regulatory network inference algorithm. These results identify the MHb as a pivotal regulator of relapse behavior and demonstrate the importance of NR4A2 as a key mechanism driving the MHb component of relapse.}},

abstract = {{The BIN1 coding variant rs138047593 (K358R) is linked to Late‐Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) via targeted exome sequencing. To elucidate the functional consequences of this rare coding variant on brain amyloidosis and neuroinflammation, we generated BIN1K358R knock‐in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These mice were subsequently bred with 5xFAD transgenic mice, which serve as a model for Alzheimer's pathology. The presence of the BIN1K358R variant leads to increased cerebral amyloid deposition, with a dampened response of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not microglia, at both the cellular and transcriptional levels. This correlates with decreased neurofilament light chain in both plasma and brain tissue. Synaptic densities are significantly increased in both wild‐type and 5xFAD backgrounds homozygous for the BIN1K358R variant. The BIN1 K358R variant modulates amyloid pathology in 5xFAD mice, attenuates the astrocytic and oligodendrocytic responses to amyloid plaques, decreases damage markers, and elevates synaptic densities. BIN1 rs138047593 (K358R) coding variant is associated with increased risk of LOAD. BIN1 K358R variant increases amyloid plaque load in 12‐month‐old 5xFAD mice. BIN1 K358R variant dampens astrocytic and oligodendrocytic response to plaques. BIN1 K358R variant decreases neuronal damage in 5xFAD mice. BIN1 K358R upregulates synaptic densities and modulates synaptic transmission.}},

NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of synaptic transmission-related genes, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction were highly cell-type dependent. Apoptosis was only modestly enriched, and the susceptibilities of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons for death were highly similar. Our analysis suggests that NFTs represent cell-type-specific responses to stress and synaptic dysfunction.

Remarkably, a single injection of wild-type microglia into adult mice repopulates the microglial niche and prevents each of these pathological changes. Taken together, these results indicate the protective functions of microglia in reducing CAA, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and brain calcification. To further understand the clinical implications of these findings, human AD tissue and iPSC-microglia were examined, providing evidence that microglia phagocytose calcium crystals, and this process is impaired by loss of the AD risk gene, TREM2.}},

Studies have shown microglia harbor an intrinsic molecular clock which regulates diurnal changes in morphology and influences inflammatory responses. In the adult brain, microglia play an important role in the regulation of condensed extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs), and it has been suggested that PNNs are also regulated in a circadian and diurnal manner. We sought to determine whether microglia mediate the diurnal regulation of PNNs via CSF1R inhibitor dependent microglial depletion in C57BL/6J mice, and how the absence of microglia might affect cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms. While we observe diurnal differences in microglial morphology, where microglia are most ramified at the onset of the dark phase, we do not find diurnal differences in PNN intensity. However, PNN intensity increases across many brain regions in the absence of microglia, supporting a role for microglia in the regulation of PNNs. Here, we also show that cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms are intact, with no cycling gene changes without microglia. These findings demonstrate a role for microglia in the maintenance of PNNs, but not in the maintenance of diurnal rhythms.}},

However, genetic risk variants commonly reside in non-coding regions and may regulate distant genes rather than the nearest gene, as well as a gene's interaction partners in biological networks. Systems biology and functional genomics approaches provide the framework to unravel the functional significance of genetic risk variants in disease. In this review, we summarize the genetic and transcriptomic studies of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies and focus on the advantages of performing systems-level analyses to interrogate the biological pathways underlying neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight new avenues of multi-omics analysis with single-cell approaches, which provides unparalleled opportunities to systematically explore cellular heterogeneity, and present an example of how to integrate publicly available single-cell datasets. Systems-level analysis has illuminated the function of many disease risk genes, but much work remains to study tauopathies and to understand spatiotemporal gene expression changes of specific cell types.}},

    abstract = "{Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by changes in cell-type proportions and consequently marked alterations of the transcriptome. Here we use a data-driven systems biology meta-analytical approach across three human ad cohorts, encompassing six cortical brain regions, and integrate with multi-scale datasets comprising of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, transcriptome- and genome-wide association studies, and quantitative trait loci to further characterize the genetic architecture of ad. We perform co-expression network analysis across more than twelve hundred human brain samples, identifying robust ad-associated dysregulation of the transcriptome, unaltered in normal human aging. We assess the cell-type specificity of ad gene co-expression changes and estimate cell-type proportion changes in human ad by integrating co-expression modules with single-cell transcriptome data generated from 27 321 nuclei from human postmortem prefrontal cortical tissue. We also show that genetic variants of ad are enriched in a microglial ad-associated module and identify key transcription factors regulating co-expressed modules. Additionally, we validate our results in multiple published human ad gene expression datasets, which can be easily accessed using our online resource (https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/consensusAD).}",

  abstract = {Adult stem-cells may serve as the cell-of-origin for cancer, yet their unbiased identification in single cell RNA sequencing data is challenging due to the high dropout rate. In the case of breast, the existence of a bipotent stem-like state is also controversial. Here we apply a marker-free algorithm to scRNA-Seq data from the human mammary epithelium, revealing a high-potency cell-state enriched for an independent mammary stem-cell expression module. We validate this stem-like state in independent scRNA-Seq data. Our algorithm further predicts that the stem-like state is bipotent, a prediction we are able to validate using FACS sorted bulk expression data. The bipotent stem-like state correlates with clinical outcome in basal breast cancer and is characterized by overexpression of YBX1 and ENO1, two modulators of basal breast cancer risk. This study illustrates the power of a marker-free computational framework to identify a novel bipotent stem-like state in the mammary epithelium.},
