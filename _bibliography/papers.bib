  abstract = {The study of transcriptomic and epigenomic variations in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly tauopathies like Pick’s disease ({PiD}) and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), offers insights into their underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we identified critical regulatory changes driving disease progression, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Our comparative analyses uncovered disease-enriched noncoding regions and genome-wide transcription factor ({TF}) binding differences, linking them to target genes. Notably, we identified a distal human-gained enhancer ({HGE}) associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase ({UBE}3A), highlighting disease-specific regulatory alterations. Additionally, fine mapping of {AD} risk genes uncovered loci enriched in microglial enhancers and accessible in other cell types. Shared and distinct {TF} binding patterns were observed in neurons and glial cells across {PiD} and {AD}. We validated our findings using {CRISPR} to excise a predicted enhancer region in {UBE}3A and developed an interactive database, {scROAD}, to visualize predicted single-cell {TF} occupancy and regulatory networks.},

This article provides a synthesis review of the conference proceedings, summarizing key discussions on biomarkers, natural history models, clinical trials, and ethical considerations in anti‐amyloid therapies. A total of 211 attendees from 16 countries joined the meeting. Global researchers presented on disease mechanisms, therapeutic developments, and patient care strategies. Discussions focused on challenges and opportunities unique to DSAD and ADAD. Experts emphasized the urgent need for tailored clinical trials for ADAD and DSAD and debated the safety and efficacy of anti‐amyloid treatments. Ethical considerations highlighted equitable access to therapies and the crucial role of patient and caregiver involvement. The conference highlighted the importance of inclusive research and collaboration across the genetic forms of AD. Biomarker research and natural history models developed in Down syndrome‐associated Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) enable the prediction of disease progression not only for DSAD and ADAD, but also for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). ‐Collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers across these genetic forms of AD will accelerate our understanding of the pathophysiology and advance preventive trials in DSAD and ADAD. ‐Tailored clinical trials for DSAD are urgently needed to address specific safety and efficacy concerns. ‐Inclusive research practices are crucial for advancing treatments and understanding of DSAD and ADAD.}},

Remyelination efficiency declines with age, and is linked to progressive disability. The gene regulatory network underlying remyelination, and how it is altered with aging, remains unclear. Here we present a comparative single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analysis of remyelination in young and aged mice. We identified gene modules dynamically expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation, revealing age-dependent changes in key processes related to myelination. Multi-omic analysis allowed us to map the regulatory network driving efficient remyelination within oligodendrocyte lineage cells in young mice. We highlight key transcription factors in the network dysregulated with age, and we describe similar dysregulations in MS lesions. Modifying the expression of these transcription factors in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells impacts differentiation. These findings provide a foundational understanding of this regenerative process in the context of aging and in chronic demyelinating diseases.}},

Here, we used single-cell sequencing of CSF cells and spatial transcriptomics of CNS lesions to compare and contrast LMD patients with CNS lymphoma (CNSL), glioblastoma (GB) and brain metastases (BrM), to neuroinflammatory CNS disorders. We identified disease-specific CSF environments, reflecting parenchymal tumor microenvironment features. CNSL showed robust T cell responses, while BrM and GB were dominated by both blood-derived and tissue-resident myeloid cells.

Studying DSAD provides an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the AD transcriptome, potentially bridging the gap between genetic mouse models and sporadic AD. We identified transcriptomic changes that may underlie cortical layer-preferential pathology accumulation. Spatial co-expression network analyses revealed transient and regionally restricted disease processes, including a glial inflammatory program dysregulated in upper cortical layers and implicated in AD genetic risk and amyloid-associated processes. Cell–cell communication analysis further contextualized this gene program in dysregulated signaling networks. Finally, we generated ST data from an amyloid AD mouse model to identify cross-species amyloid-proximal transcriptomic changes with conformational context.

Nuclear orphan receptor subfamily4 groupA member2 (NR4A2, also known as NURR1) is an important effector of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent mechanisms in persistent memory processes and is highly expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), a region that regulates nicotine-associated behaviors. Here, expressing the Nr4a2 dominant negative (Nurr2c) in the MHb blocks reinstatement of cocaine seeking in mice. We use single-nucleus transcriptomics to characterize the molecular cascade following Nr4a2 manipulation, revealing changes in transcriptional networks related to addiction, neuroplasticity, and GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling. The network controlled by NR4A2 is characterized using a transcription factor regulatory network inference algorithm. These results identify the MHb as a pivotal regulator of relapse behavior and demonstrate the importance of NR4A2 as a key mechanism driving the MHb component of relapse.}},

To elucidate the functional consequences of this rare coding variant on brain amyloidosis and neuroinflammation, we generated BIN1K358R knock‐in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These mice were subsequently bred with 5xFAD transgenic mice, which serve as a model for Alzheimer's pathology. The presence of the BIN1K358R variant leads to increased cerebral amyloid deposition, with a dampened response of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not microglia, at both the cellular and transcriptional levels. This correlates with decreased neurofilament light chain in both plasma and brain tissue. Synaptic densities are significantly increased in both wild‐type and 5xFAD backgrounds homozygous for the BIN1K358R variant. The BIN1 K358R variant modulates amyloid pathology in 5xFAD mice, attenuates the astrocytic and oligodendrocytic responses to amyloid plaques, decreases damage markers, and elevates synaptic densities. BIN1 rs138047593 (K358R) coding variant is associated with increased risk of LOAD. BIN1 K358R variant increases amyloid plaque load in 12‐month‐old 5xFAD mice.

The ENCODE4 consortium generated the first comprehensive single-nucleus resource of postnatal regulatory events across a diverse set of mouse tissues. The collection spans seven postnatal time points, mirroring human development from childhood to adulthood, and encompasses five core tissues. We identified 30 cell types, further subdivided into 69 subtypes and cell states across adrenal gland, left cerebral cortex, hippocampus, heart, and gastrocnemius muscle. Our annotations cover both known and novel cell differentiation dynamics ranging from early hippocampal neurogenesis to a new sex-specific adrenal gland population during puberty. We used an ensemble Latent Dirichlet Allocation strategy with a curated vocabulary of 2,701 regulatory genes to identify regulatory "topics," each of which is a gene vector, linked to cell type differentiation, subtype specialization, and transitions between cell states. We find recurrent regulatory topics in tissue-resident macrophages, neural cell types, endothelial cells across multiple tissues, and cycling cells of the adrenal gland and heart. Cell-type-specific topics are enriched in transcription factors and microRNA host genes, while chromatin regulators dominate mitosis topics. Corresponding chromatin accessibility data reveal dynamic and sex-specific regulatory elements, with enriched motifs matching transcription factors in regulatory topics. Together, these analyses identify both tissue-specific and common regulatory programs in postnatal development across multiple tissues through the lens of the factors regulating transcription.}},

abstract = {{The majority of mammalian genes encode multiple transcript isoforms that result from differential promoter use, changes in exonic splicing, and alternative 3′ end choice. Detecting and quantifying transcript isoforms across tissues, cell types, and species has been extremely challenging because transcripts are much longer than the short reads normally used for RNA-seq. By contrast, long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) gives the complete structure of most transcripts. We sequenced 264 LR-RNA-seq PacBio libraries totaling over 1 billion circular consensus reads (CCS) for 81 unique human and mouse samples. We detect at least one full-length transcript from 87.7\% of annotated human protein coding genes and a total of \textbackslashtextasciitilde200,000 full-length transcripts, \textbackslashtextasciitilde40\% of which have novel exon junction chains. To capture and compute on the three sources of transcript structure diversity, we introduce a gene and transcript annotation framework that uses triplets representing the transcript start site, exon junction chain, and transcript end site of each transcript. Using triplets in a simplex representation demonstrates how promoter selection, splice pattern, and 3′ processing are deployed across human tissues, with nearly half of multitranscript protein coding genes showing a clear bias toward one of the three diversity mechanisms. Evaluated across samples, the predominantly expressed transcript changes for 74\% of protein coding genes. In evolution, the human and mouse transcriptomes are globally similar in types of transcript structure diversity, yet among individual orthologous gene pairs, more than half (57.8\%) show substantial differences in mechanism of diversification in matching tissues. This initial large-scale survey of human and mouse long-read transcriptomes provides a foundation for further analyses of alternative transcript usage, and is complemented by short-read and microRNA data on the same samples and by epigenome data elsewhere in the ENCODE4 collection.}},

  abstract = {{Tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the molecular signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant cell states are unknown. We developed methods for the high-throughput isolation and transcriptome profiling of single somas with NFTs from the human AD brain, quantified the susceptibility of 20 neocortical subtypes for NFT formation and death, and identified both shared and cell-type-specific signatures. NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of synaptic transmission-related genes, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction were highly cell-type dependent. Apoptosis was only modestly enriched, and the susceptibilities of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons for death were highly similar. Our analysis suggests that NFTs represent cell-type-specific responses to stress and synaptic dysfunction. We provide a resource for biomarker discovery and the investigation of tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms of neurodegeneration.}},

  abstract = {{Microglia are strongly implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet their impact on pathology and lifespan remains unclear. Here we utilize a CSF1R hypomorphic mouse to generate a model of AD that genetically lacks microglia. The resulting microglial-deficient mice exhibit a profound shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is accompanied by numerous transcriptional changes, greatly increased brain calcification and hemorrhages, and premature lethality. Remarkably, a single injection of wild-type microglia into adult mice repopulates the microglial niche and prevents each of these pathological changes. Taken together, these results indicate the protective functions of microglia in reducing CAA, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and brain calcification. To further understand the clinical implications of these findings, human AD tissue and iPSC-microglia were examined, providing evidence that microglia phagocytose calcium crystals, and this process is impaired by loss of the AD risk gene, TREM2.}},

  abstract = {{Microglia are subject to change in tandem with the endogenously generated biological oscillations known as our circadian rhythm. Studies have shown microglia harbor an intrinsic molecular clock which regulates diurnal changes in morphology and influences inflammatory responses. In the adult brain, microglia play an important role in the regulation of condensed extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs), and it has been suggested that PNNs are also regulated in a circadian and diurnal manner. We sought to determine whether microglia mediate the diurnal regulation of PNNs via CSF1R inhibitor dependent microglial depletion in C57BL/6J mice, and how the absence of microglia might affect cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms. While we observe diurnal differences in microglial morphology, where microglia are most ramified at the onset of the dark phase, we do not find diurnal differences in PNN intensity. However, PNN intensity increases across many brain regions in the absence of microglia, supporting a role for microglia in the regulation of PNNs. Here, we also show that cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms are intact, with no cycling gene changes without microglia. These findings demonstrate a role for microglia in the maintenance of PNNs, but not in the maintenance of diurnal rhythms.}},

Here, we present a multi-omic single-nucleus study of 191,890 nuclei in late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible through our web portal, profiling chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples and uncovering vast cellular heterogeneity. We identified cell-type-specific, disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and their candidate target genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory module containing links to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell types at a subset of AD risk loci defined by genome-wide association studies, demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-nucleus approach. Trajectory analysis of glial populations identified disease-relevant transcription factors, such as SREBF1, and their regulatory targets. Finally, we introduce single-nucleus consensus weighted gene coexpression analysis, a coexpression network analysis strategy robust to sparse single-cell data, and perform a systems-level analysis of the AD transcriptome.},

abstract = {{Over the years, genetic studies have identified multiple genetic risk variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders and helped reveal new biological pathways and genes of interest. However, genetic risk variants commonly reside in non-coding regions and may regulate distant genes rather than the nearest gene, as well as a gene's interaction partners in biological networks. Systems biology and functional genomics approaches provide the framework to unravel the functional significance of genetic risk variants in disease. In this review, we summarize the genetic and transcriptomic studies of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies and focus on the advantages of performing systems-level analyses to interrogate the biological pathways underlying neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight new avenues of multi-omics analysis with single-cell approaches, which provides unparalleled opportunities to systematically explore cellular heterogeneity, and present an example of how to integrate publicly available single-cell datasets. Systems-level analysis has illuminated the function of many disease risk genes, but much work remains to study tauopathies and to understand spatiotemporal gene expression changes of specific cell types.}},

We perform co-expression network analysis across more than twelve hundred human brain samples, identifying robust ad-associated dysregulation of the transcriptome, unaltered in normal human aging. We assess the cell-type specificity of ad gene co-expression changes and estimate cell-type proportion changes in human ad by integrating co-expression modules with single-cell transcriptome data generated from 27 321 nuclei from human postmortem prefrontal cortical tissue. We also show that genetic variants of ad are enriched in a microglial ad-associated module and identify key transcription factors regulating co-expressed modules.

  abstract = {Adult stem-cells may serve as the cell-of-origin for cancer, yet their unbiased identification in single cell RNA sequencing data is challenging due to the high dropout rate. In the case of breast, the existence of a bipotent stem-like state is also controversial. Here we apply a marker-free algorithm to scRNA-Seq data from the human mammary epithelium, revealing a high-potency cell-state enriched for an independent mammary stem-cell expression module. We validate this stem-like state in independent scRNA-Seq data. Our algorithm further predicts that the stem-like state is bipotent, a prediction we are able to validate using FACS sorted bulk expression data. The bipotent stem-like state correlates with clinical outcome in basal breast cancer and is characterized by overexpression of YBX1 and ENO1, two modulators of basal breast cancer risk. This study illustrates the power of a marker-free computational framework to identify a novel bipotent stem-like state in the mammary epithelium.},
