I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of California Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in the [Swarup Lab](https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/) where I work on expanding our understanding of human neurological diseases using high-dimensional genomics approaches like single-cell and spatial -omics. I recently earned my PhD in Mathematical, Computational and Systems Biology [(MCSB)](https://ccbs.uci.edu/education/mcsb/) at UC Irvine, and I am continuing my research career as a Computational Biology Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico](https://www.cnag.eu/) in Barcelona starting in spring 2024.

Outside of the lab, my favorite things to do include making and drinking specialty coffee, playing with my cats Kiki and Junior, listening to music (mostly metal!), and gaming.
