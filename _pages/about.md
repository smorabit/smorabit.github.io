I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Single Cell Genomics Group](https://www.cnag.eu/teams/genome-research-unit/single-cell-genomics-group) at the [Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico](https://www.cnag.eu/) in Barcelona, Spain. My research focuses on applying single-cell and spatial -omics to human diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. I also work on bioinformatics method development, including the R package [hdWGCNA](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/). I earned my PhD in Mathematical, Computational and Systems Biology [(MCSB)](https://ccbs.uci.edu/education/mcsb/) at the [University of California Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in lab of [Dr. Vivek Swarup](https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/).

Outside of the lab, my favorite things to do include making and drinking specialty coffee, playing with my cats Kiki and Junior, listening to music (mostly metal!), and gaming.
