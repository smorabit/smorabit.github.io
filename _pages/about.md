Hello! I am a postdoc in the [Single Cell Genomics Group](https://www.cnag.eu/teams/genome-research-unit/single-cell-genomics-group) at the [Centre Nacional d'Anàlisi Genòmica](https://www.cnag.eu/) in Barcelona, Spain. Currently, my research focuses on studying metastatic colorectal cancer using single-cell transcriptomics and T-cell receptor sequencing. During my PhD in Mathematical, Computational and Systems Biology [(MCSB)](https://ccbs.uci.edu/education/mcsb/) at the [University of California Irvine](https://uci.edu/), I studied transcriptomic and epigenomic changes throughout the progression of Alzheimer's Disease in lab of [Dr. Vivek Swarup](https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/). I also work on bioinformatic methods development, most notably the R package [hdWGCNA](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/) for gene co-expression network analysis. I am currently working on [compact](https://smorabit.github.io/compact/) for in-silico perturbation analysis and [chromatic](https://smorabit.github.io/chromatic/) for epigenomic erosion analysis. 
 

These days, in my spare time I am improving my Catalan speaking at the [CPNL](https://www.cpnl.cat/). My favorite things to do outside of the lab include exploring Barcelona and Catalonia 🧭 drinking specialty coffee ☕ going to concerts 🎸 playing board games 🎲 going to the beach 🌴 and spending time with my cats Kiki and Junior 🐈‍⬛
