I was recently awarded a Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (F31)
from the National Institute on Aging for my research proposal titled "Single-cell
epigenomic roadmap of Alzheimer's disease". This preliminary results for this
project can be found in my [Nature Genetics paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00894-z). I am immensely thankful for the support system in my 
lab and at UC Irvine that helped me to achieve this fellowship.
