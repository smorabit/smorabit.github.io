hdWGCNA, an R package that I developed for performing co-expression network
analysis in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, is now on bioRxiv! hdWGCNA
uses Seurat objects and essentially begins where the [Seurat tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) ends. Check out the [hdWGCNA manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.22.509094v1) on bioRxiv and the [hdWGCNA R package](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/) on GitHub.
